# Zadie Moon – Portfolio

https://zprintln.github.io/me/

This is my portfolio! It’s where I show what I’ve built, organized, and learned—both in tech and in community.

I grew up in a low-income household with **no screens**, but a lot of curiosity. That shaped how I approach technology: empathetically, obsessively, and always thinking about **how things scale for everyone**.
